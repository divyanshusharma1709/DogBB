# Custom CNN for Dog Detection
The files in this repository are used to create a custom CNN for object detection (generating bounding boxes).
This project uses custom loss functions and mAP metrics to train a CNN on a dataset.

## Files
1. LabelsGenerator.ipynb: An IPython Notebook which includes code to generate the labels in the form required (x_mp, y_mp, w, h).
2. dogCNN.ipynb: An IPython Notebook which includes code for the network architecture, the custom loss function and metrics.
3. cnnop.txt, notes.txt, observations.txt: Notes to help me through the process of creating the model.
